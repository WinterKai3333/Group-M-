Software Engineering Group Project (Campus Navigation System) 

# Project Overview

The Campus Navigation System is designed as a solution to assist the students of 
The University of Nottingham Malaysia by providing an efficient and user-friendly 
navigation system for the campus. This system aims to simplify the process of 
locating rooms or specific locations such as lecture rooms, offices and more within 
the university without the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS), helping 
students or guests to find their way to their intended destination. The key features
of this system includes user input of current and destination location, pre-defined 
routes, and web accessibility.
